Java_LinkedListStack
====================

####The Stack class represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of objects. 
The usual push and pop operations are provided, as well as a method to peek at the top item on the stack, a method to test for whether the stack is empty, and a method to search the stack for an item and discover how far it is from the top.
When a stack is first created, it contains no items.

####The Stack class contains the following functionalities.
*  Stack(): Creates an empty Stack.
*  empty(): Tests if this stack is empty.
*  top(): Looks at the object at the top of this stack without removing it from the stack.
*  push(items): Pushes an item onto the top of this stack.
*  pop(): Removes the object at the top of this stack and returns that object as the value of this function.
*  search(items): Returns the 1-based position where an object is on this stack.
